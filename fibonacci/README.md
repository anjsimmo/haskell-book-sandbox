# Fib

An exploration of different methods to implement the Fibonacci sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...

```
stack ghci
Prelude> :l fib.hs
*Fib> take 30 fibs1 -- Slow
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17711,28657,46368,75025,121393,196418,317811,514229]
*Fib> take 30 fibs2 -- Much faster
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17711,28657,46368,75025,121393,196418,317811,514229]
